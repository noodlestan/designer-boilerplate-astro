## Space Unit

The space unit is the foundation of our spacing system, defining the base increment used across all scales. By keeping a consistent starting point, we ensure predictable and harmonious spacing throughout the design.

## Spacing scales

Our spacing scales define how elements grow and relate to one another, creating a structured and cohesive layout.

### Component sizing

This scale ensures that different UI elements, like buttons and inputs, remain aligned across their variants. By following a structured scale, we maintain consistency between similar components, ensuring a harmonious and balanced interface.

### Layout spacing

Layout spacing ensures consistent gaps and paddings across the interface. It follows a geometric progression, doubling at each step, so that spacing remains flexible yet structured.

### Vertical spacing

Vertical rhythm is essential for clear and structured layouts. Our layout rhythm scale builds on the horizontal spacing, maintaining proportionality and ensuring that vertical gaps align with the overall spacing system.
