## Brand Color

Our brand colors define the visual identity of our branded elements, ensuring consistency across all touchpoints. These colors are carefully selected to represent our brandâ€™s personality and should be used in logo applications and branded visuals.

### Primary Colors

The primary colors in our brand identity include our signature pink and blue. These colors are reserved for branded elements and should not be used for typography, backgrounds, or interactive elements.
